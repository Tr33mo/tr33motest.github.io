Recently posted on the [Vetiver Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vetivernetwork/permalink/10156671259142760/) is an illustration on [this page](http://www.vetiver.org/CHN%20Draw%20down/china%20paper3.htm) of long-term inundation of Vetiver in China.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/vetivernetwork/permalink/10155820032967760/" target="_blank">Anecdotally</a>, the Vetiver here on the Sunshine Coast during the wet season of late 2017/early 2018 resulted in our barely established Vetiver suffering inundation for several months, off and on; the longest period being 3 months. The Vetiver had been planted in a disused Water Chestnut paddy.

Update (16/10/2018): Record October rains have occurred and the Vetiver is underwater again: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/vetivernetwork/permalink/10156727977487760/" target="_blank">Facebook Link</a> for photos.
