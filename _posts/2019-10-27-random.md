The first four photos are of a garden edge where Vetiver is used with native plants as a mulch creator and barrier to 'invasive' grasses as they try to enter the bed. This bed also demonstrates that shade-loving plants such as the strappy green *Lomandra hystrix* could be planted with Vetiver to replace the hedge when it is potentially shaded out during successful reveg projects that close canopy. This bed faces north and the Vetiver and Lomandra both provide weed and evaporation reduction to the garden within.

Here are more recent photos of the greywater after hedging and demonstrates the difference between irrigated and non-irrigated hedges.

This photo attempts to showcase integration between different plants. Note how dry the failed pond wall (pre-existing) is due to the lack of any weed growth yet the Vetiver appears to be growing well. Pictured here from left to right are [Inga Alleys](http://www.ingafoundation.org/) and coppice/pollard Olive mulching recently planted seed-grown Spiny Mandarin. Cages are for wallaby/kangaroo/cow/deer/brush turkey protection and are made from an old recycled fence. The Vetiver has created small terraces and I use them to travel across the wall by placing feet on top edge of clump when carrying in material to mulch with. If you have steep banks, I highly recommend Vetiver hedges to both reduce and facilitate access for maintenance.
