Vetiver Grass can be used as borders to plantings but they also can supply other benefits. Seen here is a recent application of Vetiver hedges being used to protect a line of *Albizia lebbeck* pollards from getting hit with a mower deck during errant driving. As the Albizia will be cut back on a yearly/bi-yearly cycle, the shade should not have a negative effect on the hedge. As the Vetiver is cut for mulch, it will be placed in the internal area to reduce competition from the pasture grasses.

Vetiver can also be used to hold back mulch or protect plantings from chickens, brushturkeys, or similar animals.
