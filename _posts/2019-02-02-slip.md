Pictured here is a Before and After of a debris slide on a landslip site after a moderate downpour of rain. There is no overland flow into this "gully", a spring causes the constant water flow and subsequent landslides. Vetiver in this situation has little time to establish before the next potential slide so failure rate could be high.

Beginning works on the site. After the driest January on record, the top rows are dry and the spring is still wet.

Work continues between wide tension cracks in the soil and oozing mud slides. Rows are placed where they best fit, not at any predetermined distance and tend to finish early when they reach a crack. A double row has been placed in the worst of the mud as a measure to stop the slow movement hypothetically sooner than later.

Further rows are placed on another day. The lower rows are directly inserted into mud and seeping/standing water.

Work will continue and updates will be posted in the future.
