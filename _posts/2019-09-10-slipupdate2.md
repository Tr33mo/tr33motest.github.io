A short update of Site 2 in Bridge Creek, North Maleny after the previous visit and [blog post.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-09-06-slipupdate.md %})

This was trimmed with a serrated grass hand sickle with minor weeding between rows. Cut grass is placed behind the row to accelerate and add to the soil capture.
