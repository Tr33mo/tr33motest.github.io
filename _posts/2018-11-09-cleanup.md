Here are some photos of hedging and weeding some of the Vetiver propagation clumps. 

Cutting the clump can increase tillering in the right conditions. Initially (after planting) cutting is performed after 4 months of active growth and then maintenance cuts are made after that. Cutting for biomass can be done 2-4 times a year depending on rainfall and nutrient on mature clumps.
