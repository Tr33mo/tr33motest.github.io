Slip 1 is a debris slide on top of a spring that is incorporated into a massive historical landslide.

Slip 2 is a slip face with a channelised spring running through it which is connected to a road batter. Slip 2 is showing a distinct backing up of soil behind the hedges even in these early stages, indicating some arrest and saving of soil. Araucaria planted just before the hedges are doing well.
