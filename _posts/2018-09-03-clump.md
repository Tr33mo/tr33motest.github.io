Illustrated here is a 5 year old clump that has been let go so as to demonstrate potential size in moist conditions.

Revealed here is 143 propagation pieces not including the crown pieces pictured behind (which are viable plants). The amount of effort required to divide a clump of this size is not economical. Usually clumps aged between 12-24 months are divided.
