Illustrated here is a before/after cutting on a dam/pond wall batter. This is a dry deco batter that had high erosion potential. Weeds, and most plants, struggle to grow on here.

This is an example of how Vetiver hedges on contour can often 'self-level' terraces behind them. Material has eroded from the right of frame and has backed up behind the hedge on the left of frame, almost forming a completely level area. Note the bare soil with a minimum of unwanted plant growth.
